        <ol>
            <li>Everything on this list is subject to change at any time without warning.</li>
            <li>Only one account may be registered per IP address until the beta phase ends.</li>
            <li>This beta phase is designed to encourage bug reports and suggestions. If you find a bug or have an idea which could improve the service we offer, please contact us by email at beta@bitsweeper.org.</li>
            <li>Withdrawals will not be possible until either the end of the open beta phase or 30th September 2014 - whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>Your BitSweeper.org-generated Bitcoin address must contain a minimum of 10,000 micro-Bitcoins before any bets are made. This 10,000 micro-Bitcoin lock is in place to cover Blockchain's imposed miners' fee.</li>
            <li>We can't guarantee that we will be able to fund any profit you may have at the end of the open beta phase, however we will guarantee that you will get your initial deposit back plus the 10,000 micro-Bitcoin miners' fee in the event that this happens.</li>

        <h2 id="what-is-bitcoin"><i class="fa fa-bitcoin"></i> What is Bitcoin?</h2>

        <p>Bitcoin is an incredibly secure, decentralized, open source crypto-currency which allows for instant peer-to-peer payments across the world with zero or low processing fees, heralded by many as the <i>currency of the future</i>.</p>

        <p>You can read all about Bitcoin at <a href="https://bitcoin.org/">https://bitcoin.org</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-play"><i class="fa fa-check"></i> How do I play?</h2>

        <p>BitSweeper.org places you on a 25-square (5x5) grid. Each individual square is called a <i>tile</i>. Once you begin the game, the aim is to click on any tile and hope you don't hit a <i class="fa fa-bomb"></i><em>Bomb</em>. The more tiles you successfully click on, the more you can win - however if you find a bomb it's game over.</p>
        <p>At any point in the game you can <em>Cash Out</em>. This allows you to walk away with the profit you've currently earned and start a new game if you so desire.</p>
        <p>The Game Type you select determines how many bombs can be found on the grid. This is documented in the <a href="https://bitsweeper.org/faq#how-does-each-game-type-work"><em>How does each game type work?</em></a> section below.</p>
        <p>The earnings rate is applied to both your initial bet and the profit you're currently making. On top of this, the earnings rate increases with every successful click made. This is also documented below in the <a href="https://bitsweeper.org/faq#earnings-rate"><em>How does the earnings rate affect my bet?</em></a> section below.</p>
        <p>The minimum amount you can bet is 100, but the higher your bet, the greater the profit you stand to make.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="provably-fair"><i class="fa fa-check-square"></i> BitSweeper.org is Provably Fair, what does this mean?</h2>

        <p>When you begin each game, we calculate the bomb positions and encrypt them with a secret key. The encrypted data is revealed to you in the <i>BitSweeper is Provably Fair</i> section below each game you play in the "Encrypted String" text area as soon as the game starts. When your game ends, the secret key will then be displayed in the "Key" text field. You can then plug the encrypted data and the secret key into any online decryption tool (such as Code Beautify's <a href="http://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt">Online Encrypt Decrypt String tool</a>) to verify your game's outcome.</p>
        <p>The encryption algorithm we use is <strong>Gost</strong>, and the encryption mode we use is <strong>ECB</strong> - you'll need to specify these when decrypting.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the decryption will give you a result which looks something like this:</p>

        <figure>
            <code>{"cells":[0,0,2,0,0]},{"cells":[2,0,0,0,0]},{"cells":[0,0,0,0,0]},{"cells":[0,0,0,0,0]},{"cells":[0,2,0,0,0]}]}</code>
        </figure>

        <p>Empty tiles are represented by <code>0</code> and bombs are represented by <code>2</code>. The number of bombs present is determined by the <a href="#how-does-each-game-type-work">Game Type</a> you have chosen.</p>

        <p>The easiest way to visualise this is to move each of the "cells" onto their own line:</p>

        <figure>
            <code>{"cells":[0,0,2,0,0]},<br>
                  {"cells":[2,0,0,0,0]},<br>
                  {"cells":[0,0,0,0,0]},<br>
                  {"cells":[0,0,0,0,0]},<br>
                  {"cells":[0,2,0,0,0]}]}</code>
        </figure>

        <p>In this particular instance, the bombs are located at row 1 cell 3, row 2 cell 1 and row 5 cell 2:</p>

	    <h2 id="transferring-in"><i class="fa fa-rotate-left"></i> Transfering Micro-Bitcoins in</h2>

	    <h3 id="no-fees-for-transferring-in">Are there any fees imposed when transferring funds to a BitSweeper.org-generated address?</h3>
	    <p>No. When you transfer funds to us you will be able to play with the exact amount sent over. Do be warned, however, that third-party companies may impose their own fees for sending money to us - these are out of our control.</p>

	    <h3 id="where-is-my-address">Where can I find my BitSweeper.org-generated Bitcoin address?</h3>
	    <p>Your unique BitSweeper.org-generated Bitcoin address is clearly visible in the top right of the page when visiting your own unique URL.</p>

	    <h3 id="how-can-i-transfer-funds">How can I transfer funds to my BitSweeper.org address?</h3>
	    <p>To transfer funds into BitSweeper.org you have several available options:</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>
	    		<strong>Transfering from another Bitcoin address</strong>
	    		If you already have a Bitcoin balance stored in a different address, you can transfer this directly to your own BitSweeper.org-generated Bitcoin address by specifying that you want to move money to the address displayed at the top right of the screen when playing the game.
                <br>
                We also implement a QR code which you can scan on to copy your address to your mobile device without having to type it out each time. This can be revealed by clicking on your address.
	    	</li>
	    	<li>
	    		<strong>Purchasing Bitcoins directly to your BitSweeper.org-generated Bitcoin address</strong>
	    		You can purchase funds directly to your BitSweeper.org-generated Bitcoin address by using this address when purchasing Bitcoins from any Bitcoin exchange service.
	    	</li>
	    	<li>
	    		<strong>Getting them for free</strong>
	    		<a href="https://www.landofbitcoin.com/?r=uNoyOd5jkmQGM3lZ">Land of Bitcoin</a> lists hundreds of websites which reward you small amounts of Micro-Bitcoins every time you visit their website and fill out a captcha. These are transfered automatically to a variety of Micro-Bitcoin wallets (such as <a href="http://microwallet.org">MicroWallet</a>) which will distribute these to your address once you reach the minimum threshold of 0.00005 (5000 Micro-Bitcoins).
	    	</li>
	    </ul>

		<h2 id="transferring-out"><i class="fa fa-rotate-right"></i> Transferring Micro-Bitcoins out</h2>

		<h3 id="how-often-can-I-withdraw">How often can I withdraw funds?</h3>
		<p>Once per day you can request to transfer your winnings out of the Bitcoin address we have provided you with and into your own personal Bitcoin address.</p>

		<h3 id="what-should-I-know">What should I know before withdrawing funds?</h3>
		<p>There are a few small details which you should be aware of before transfering:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Transactions may take up to 72 hours to process</strong>
				We manage withdrawals automatically every 48 hours. This means that you should have the funds transfered to your own address within 72 hours of requesting a withdrawal <small>(note that the extra 24 hours is the time it may take for your funds to be transfered over the Bitcoin network)</small>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Minimum transaction: 16,000 Micro-Bitcoins <small>(0.00005 BTC)</small></strong>
				Every transaction has a miners' fee of 0.0001 BTC (10,000 Micro-Bitcoins) imposed by our API provider, <a href="https://blockchain.info">Blockchain</a>. On top of that, the minimum amount which can be transfered over the Bitcoin network is 0.00005 BTC (5000 Micro-Bitcoins). The remaining 0.00001 BTC (1000 Micro-Bitcoins) is a gratitude to help keep our servers running <small>(see below)</small>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Maximum weekly transaction: 54,357,825 Micro-Bitcoins <small>(0.49999999 BTC)</small></strong>
				To ensure that we are never in a situation where we ourselves do not have enough funds, we enforce a weekly transaction limit of 0.49999999 BTC (54,357,825 Micro-Bitcoins).
                <br><br>
                <div class="warning info">
                    <span class="icon">
                        <i class="fa fa-bug"></i>
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        <b>Important:</b> For the duration of the Beta, the maximum weekly transaction will be capped at 100,000 Micro-Bitcoins <small>(0.001 BTC)</small>.
                    </span>
                </div>
                <br>
            </li>
			<li>
				<strong>Gratitude</strong>
				In order for us to continue providing a good service after the Blockchain miners' fee we take either 0.00001 BTC or 8% of the remainder of your transaction (depending on which is greater) on every transaction made. This ensures that there will always be funds left to both keep the server running and keep the game working as intended.
			</li>
		</ul>

        <h3 id="miners-fee">10000 Micro-Bitcoin Miners' Fee</h3>
        <p>The miners' fee imposed by Blockchain is deducted from your account prior to any bets being placed. Until the Bitcoin network upgrades its handling of micro-transactions, this is unfortunately something which we cannot avoid.</p>

		<h3 id="withdrawal-breakdown-table">Withdrawal Breakdown Table</h3>
		<p>We care about transparency and strive to ensure that you are aware of any fees which are added to the withdrawals you make. Every time you withdraw you will be given a breakdown of exactly what you will receive, what Blockchain will receive, and the gratitude you give to us. Below is a breakdown of the minimum and maximum withdrawals, along with some other example transactions.</p>
