[BitSweeper](https://bitsweeper.org) is a micro-bitcoin minesweeper-esque gambling website, currently in open beta.

This repository has been created as a public-facing issue tracker, allowing users to view applied and pending changes and to submit bugs and suggestions. Eventually I intend to make the entire website open source, so watch this space!

The FAQ which has been comitted to this GitHub project can be viewed live at [BitSweeper.org/faq](https://bitsweeper.org/faq).
